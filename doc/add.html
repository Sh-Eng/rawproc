<h3 id="Add">Add</h3>
<p>Purpose: Adds a value from each channel of each pixel of the image.  Two modes:

<ul>

<li><b>value:</b> Adds the value from every channel value of every pixel in the image.  
Remember, the internal working image is floating point, 0.0 - 1.0, so meaningful subtractions
are with numbers in that range.  But, you can do what you want...  :D Actually, I don't know 
what practical use this mode might be...
</li>

<li><b>file:</b> Opens the selected image file, and adds every corresponding channel value of
every pixel of it from the working image.  Unlike subtract, add will allow a smaller image, 
oriented to one of the four corners: topleft, topright, bottomleft, bottomright.  This mode 
is useful for adding watermarks to images, where the image to be added is a black-background, 
white-text image formatted to display nicely in one of the corners.
</li>

</ul>
