<h2 id="MenuActions">Menu Actions</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>File->Open:</b> Brings up a dialog box in which you can select a 
file to open.  rawproc recognizes JPEG, TIFF, and PNG 
"planar" (not pallete-based) images, as well as the full 
complement of raw formats recognized by the linked LibRaw 
library.  Note that 4-channel (alpha) images can be opened, but 
the internal gImage library strips the alpha channel when 
converting the image array to floating point.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Re-Open:</b> Re-opens the previously opened file.  Helpful if you're trying various raw
parameters.  If the previous open was Open Source, the source image will be opened and its command
parameters applied, including the raw parameters with which the image was originally built.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Open Source:</b> Brings up a dialog box in which you can select a file to open.  But, what then 
happens is that the selected file is inspected for a rawproc command list; if one is found, 
the original file specified in that list is opened instead, and the rest of the manipulation command list is
applied to the opened image.  The original image has to be in the same directory as the selected image.
This takes a bit of time, so be patient.  When finished, the sourced filename is displayed first in the 
title bar, then the file created from the source in parens.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Save:</b> Brings up a dialog box in which you can specify a filename to save the image.  The
image type is determined by what extension you give to the file name, .jpg or .tif.  Save will
always bring up a dialog, whether you're saving to the same file or a new one.  When finished, the 
originally opened file name is still displayed in the title bar, but the saved file name is added, in 
parens.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Exit:</b>  Does what is says.  There is no prompt to save an unsaved image, so be careful.</li><br>

<li><b>Edit->Cut/Copy/Paste:</b> These menu items work on the list of tools applied to the image, so you can 
cut/copy a selected command and paste it elsewhere in the list.</li><br>

<li><b>Edit->Properties:</b> Opens a dialog box for editing all of the configuration parameters from rawproc.conf.
Parameters can be added or deleted with the Add and Delete buttons.  Changing a parameter requires
clicking in the value cell, keyboard editing the value, and typing Return.  Clicking Dismiss will also save a
parameter in the middle of editing.  Changed parameter values are saved to the .conf file immediately upon 
change.  Parameters are presented in sorted order, but the original order and
formatting of the .conf file is preserved. The filter box allows culling the list to find selected parameters; 
typing a string immediately culls the list to those that contain the string.  See the Configuration topic for
more information on the available parameters.</li><br>

<li><b>Edit->EXIF:</b> Opens a dialog box containing the output of running exiftool on the opened image file.
Provides a more comprehensive listing of the image metadata than the Image Information menu in the command
pop-up menu.  A path to exiftool must be present in exif.command in the Properties list.</li><br>

<li><b>Edit->Edit Metadata:</b> Opens a dialog box containing the image metadata <i>from the selected
tool in the ToolChain</i>.  You can add, change, and delete metadata tags here, note that changing
the tags destined for export requires specific attention to the accuracy of the tag name and value
format.  <b>Note: Changing a tag in a given tool image DOES NOT automatically change that tag in 
downstream tool images; you need to instigate a change in the current tool to make metadata changes 
properly propagate through the rest of the tool chain.</b></li><br>

<li><b>Data update:</b>Kicks off a version check, download, and installation of a newer version of the
lensfun database than is presently installed at tool.lenscorrection.databasepath, or installs it if not 
already there.</li><br>

<li><b>Edit->Batch:</b>Opens a dialog box where a batch run of the img command line program can be
configured and executed.  Details are described at <a href=batch.html>Batch Processing</a></li><br>

<li><b>Add->(tool):</b> Selecting one of the tools from this menu adds it to the Commands list,
after the selected tool.  See the sub-topics for more enlightenment on the various image tools.</li><br>

<li><b>Add->Group:</b> A group is a collection of tools, similar to a tool list.  The big difference is that
a list of tools specified as a group are applied using a copy of the previous tool's image, and only one 
result image is stored for the group.  Until version 0.9, processing an image in rawproc involved opening 
the file, then applying a succession of tools in whatever order, and finally saving the resulting image 
from the  output of the last tool.  Each tool added to the chain contained its own result image, so the 
tool chain concept is quite a memory hog.  The group tool allows one to specify a list of tools that are 
used often and apply them in a single tool operation, resulting in a significant reduction in memory use.

<p>Groups can be defined in text files just like tool lists, each tool on a separate line; in fact, the 
syntax is identical.  A group can also be defined as follows:

<pre>
group:resize:800;sharpen:1
</pre>

with the tools separated by semicolons, either in the input.raw.libraw.default property or in an img 
command line parameter.  Indeed, a rather useful group for input.raw.libraw.default would be:

<pre>
group:colorspace:camera,assign;subtract:camera;whitebalance:camera;demosaic:ahd;blackwhitepoint:rgb
</pre>

or in a text file:

<pre>
colorspace:camera,assign
subtract:camera
whitebalance:camera
demosaic:ahd
blackwhitepoint:rgb
</pre>

either which for a raw file would provide a scaled RGB image for further editing.  When a group is
added to the toolchain, it looks like this in the commands pane:</p>

<p align=left><img src=group-commandlist.png></img></p>



</li><br>

<li><b>Add->Tool List:</b> Opens a file selector on the directory specified in app.toollistpath (or the 
current working directory if app.toollistpath is empty) to allow selection of a file containing a list
of tools to be inserted in the processing chain below the currently selected tool.  The list in the file
has one tool per line, like this:
<pre>
resize:800
sharpen:1
</pre>
The insertion of the tools cannot be undone.  Make sure you have the right tool selected before inserting
the tool list.  Tool list files can be created with any text editor.  If a property needs to be
set to a certain value, specify it with a set: command, which will only apply for the toollist.
Here's a complete example, turns a color negative image into a normal positive:
<pre>
set:tool.blackwhitepoint.auto=1
blackwhitepoint:red
blackwhitepoint:green
blackwhitepoint:blue
curve:rgb,0,255,255,0
whitebalance:auto
</pre>
</li><br>

<li><b>Help->Show Command:</b> Brings up a dialog box showing the command list that would be saved
to the image EXIF if you saved the file at that point.</li><br>

<li><b>Help->About:</b> Brings up a dialog box that shows the rawproc description and version, versions of
all the included libraries, the pixel format, the directory containing the rawproc.conf file read at startup, 
and optionally the build date, depending on how rawproc was compiled. </li><br>

</ul>
