<h3 id="Tone">Tone</h3>
<p>Applies the selected tone curve to the image.  This is just a somewhat random selection of functions, mainly for messing
with.</p>
<p align=center><img src=tone.png></img></p>

<p>Available tone operators:
<ul>
<li><b>lut:</b> Applies a 1DLUT specified by the selected file.  The file should contain a list of numbers from 0.0 to 1.0 that describe a curve. The following C program creates a 1DLUT of the proper format for the ARIB STD-B67 log-gamma curve:
<pre>
//Compile: g++ -o loggamma loggamma.c
//Usage: ./loggamma > loggamma.lut

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

float lin2loggamma(float in)
{
        double a = 0.17883277, b = 0.28466892, c = 0.55991073;
        double rubicon = 1.0/12.0;
        double sqrt3 = sqrt(3);

        if (in > rubicon) 
                return a * log(12*in - b) + c; 
        else 
                return sqrt3 * pow(in, 0.5); 
}

int main()
{
	float in, log;
	float increment = 1.0 / 20.0; //20 steps, make this larger for better resolution...
	
	for (in=0.0; in&lt;=1.0; in+=increment) 
		printf("%f\n", lin2loggamma(in));
}


</pre>
<li><b>gamma:</b> The same function as in the original gamma tool, which will eventually be removed.  Default: 1.0, or no-change.</li>
<li><b>reinhart:</b> Applies the simple Reinhart function, val / (1-val), to either the individual channels, or as a computed 
change to the luminance of each pixel.  Default: channel.</li>
<li><b>loggamma:</b> The HEVC version of the ARIB STD-B67 algorithm, as defined in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Log-Gamma>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Log-Gamma</a></li>
<li><b>doublelogistic:</b>This is a filmic-sort of curve, the toe provided by one logistic function, the mid-part and upper
roll-off provided by another logistic function.  Two parameters:
<ul>
	<li>L: Scales both functions and is the point where the two curves meet.  Use this parameter to place the toe.</li>
	<li>c: Sets the steepness of the middle part of both curves.  Use this parameter to lift/lower the image brightness.</li>
</ul>
The function description can be found at <a href=https://discuss.pixls.us/t/new-sigmoid-scene-to-display-mapping/22635/76>https://discuss.pixls.us/t/new-sigmoid-scene-to-display-mapping/22635/76</a></li>

<li><b>filmic:</b> The filmic algorithm is the original one, attributed to HP Duiker, copied from John Hable's blog: <pre>
R(x) = pow((x(6.2x+.5))/(x(6.2x+1.7)+0.06),2.2)
</pre>  
rawproc parameterizes the coefficients as follows: 
<pre>
y = pow((x(Ax+B))/(x(Ax+C))+D,Power)
</pre>

Usage notes:
<ul>
	<li>The Power coefficient is really an inverse gamma, used in Hable's blog post to compare filmic to Reinhard.  
	Setting it to 1.0 nulls its effect.</li>
	<li>A affects the middle part of the curve.</li>
	<li>B affects the toe of the curve, flattening it as the value is reduced.</li>
	<li>C affects the shoulder of the curve.</li>
	<li>D inversely affects the toe of the curve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The numbers in the various parameter boxes can be changed with the mouse thumbwheel, incremented/decremented with each 
notch.  For float parameters, holding the Ctrl key while rolling the thumbwheel changes the third digit from the right; 
holding the Shift key changes the second digit from the right; rolling the thumbwheel with no key pressed changes the 
rightmost digit.</p>

<p>
The curve plot at the bottom of the tool pane graphically depicts the chosen tone curve.  The curve is computed using the 
actual tone curve operation, applied to a synthetic one-row image with monotonically increasing tone values from 0.0 - 1.0.
The curve can be zoomed using the mouse scroll wheel; Shift-scroll and Ctrl-scroll increase the zoom rate by 10 and 100, respectively.
The zoom scale can be reset to 1.0 by double-clicking in the curve plot.
</p>

<p>The norm checkbox enables/disables normalization to 0.0 - 1.0 of reinhard and filmic, which by themselves never reach 1.0.
The loggamma operator does this by definition, per the HEVC specification.  gamma is hard-coded to normalize.
