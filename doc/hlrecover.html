<h3 id="Highlight Recovery">Highlight Recovery</h3>
<p>This tool is based on the RawTherapee highlight recovery tool, graciously provided in librtprocess.  rawproc's integration
of this tool is decidedly less feature-rich than RawTherapee; indeed, there are no parameters for the user to mess with.</p>
<p>The specific use case for this tool is in the mitigation of over-exposed highlights.  If you whitebalance, demosaic, and 
then apply a blackwhitepoint tool that scales to the data extents and you see either magenta or cyan discoloration in your 
highlights, add this tool and it <b>should</b> go away.  There are dependencies on the demosaic algorithm used and/or the 
amount of blown highlights that I do not yet understand, so this tool may not mitigate your particular situation.  In that
case, a rather coarse way to deal with it is to select the minwhite checkbox in data option of the blackwhite tool, which 
will put the white point at the lowest max of R, G, and B, effectively driving blown highlights to white.</p>  

<p>Really, you should endeavor to expose to preserve your highlights...</p>
