<p>When started, rawproc will present you with a window containing four panes:</p><br>

<ol>
	<li><b>Display:</b> The right-hand window, contains the image being manipulated.  There is also a thumbnail 
	window in the top-left corner; if the image size is greater than the display panel, the thumbnail will
	also contain a viewport rectangle that can be dragged to pan the display image.
	You can toggle the thumb visibility by double-clicking in the thumb.  For the 
	display image, you can zoom in or out of the image in 5% increments using the mousewheel, or toggle 
	100%/fit-to-display by double-clicking the image.  The min/max zoom is presently 10%/500%.<br><br>
	Display pane keyboard commands:
	<ul>
		<li>-: zoom out</li>
		<li>+: zoom in</li>
		<li>Ctrl-c: Copy RGB values at the mouse x,y</li>
		<li>e: Exposure box toggle</li>
		<li>f,F: Fit image to window</li>
		<li>h: Toggle display thumbnail at the upper-left corner</li>
		<li>n: Take a snapshot of the display window.  This can be done repeatedly.</li>
		<li>o: Out-of-bound toggle.  Rotates between off|RGB average|at least one channel</li>
		<li>s: Softproof toggle</li>
		<li>t,T: Tooltip toggle</li>
		<li>left-arrow: Pan left, Shift = x10, Ctrl = x100</li>
		<li>right-arrow: Pan right, Shift = x10, Ctrl = x100</li>
		<li>down-arrow: Pan down, Shift = x10, Ctrl = x100</li>
		<li>up-arrow: Pan up, Shift = x10, Ctrl = x100</li>
	</ul><br><br>
	For color management, display.cms enables/disables transform of the 
	image from the checked tool to the display profile before rendering in the display pane.  The internal working
	image has to have an attached profile, and an appropriate profile has to be entered in display.cms.displayprofile.
	</li><br>

	<li><b>Commands:</b> The top-left-hand window, contains the list of tools applied to the image.  This list of tools 
	is usually referred to as the "toolchain".  You can select a tool to mess with by left-clicking it.  Right-clicking 
	a tool 	brings up a pop-up menu from which you can display EXIF and image data, delete the
	tool, or if the tool is a group, break the group in to the toolchain or extract the last tool in the group and make it
	a tool in the toolchain. The checkbox beside each tool is to
	select that tool result for display; this can be done separate from selecting the tool to
	mess with its parameters.  This is extremely useful to compare the results of different tools,
	as the display is switched from image to image without having to reprocess, at the expense of
	memory<br><br>
	Command pane keyboard commands:
	<ul>
		<li>ctrl-c: Copies the selected comand and its parameters to the clipboard.</li>
		<li>ctrl-x: Cuts the selected command and its parameters from the list, puts them in the clipboard.</li>
		<li>ctrl-v: Pastes the command/parameters in the clipboard to the list, after the selected command.</li>
	</ul>
	</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Histogram:</b> Standard RGB histogram of the image produced by the tool selected for display.  
	It can be zoomed in with the mouse thumbwheel, and panned
	by dragging with the mouse. Double-clicking the histogram restores the original scale and origin. 
	The default scale is 256 bins; this can be changed with the 
	histogram.scale parameter in the Properties list, for instance, to set 65536 for sixteen-bit 
	scaling. Note that the default of 256 supports the curve tool, which works on a 0-255 range. 
	if you change the histogram tool scaling, the curve tool will still work internally at 0.0-255.0.<br><br>
	Histogram pane keyboard commands:
	<ul>
		<li>space: Toggle channel order in display</li>
		<li>Ctrl-c: Copy 256-bucket histogram to the clipboard</li>
		<li>d: Toggle bounded/unbounded histogram, display bounds/data bounds</li>
		<li>e: Toggle EV stop lines</li>
		<li>l Toggle labels</li>
		<li>t: Toggle tooltip display</li>
		<li>right-arrow: Pan right, Shift = x10, Ctrl = x100</li>
		<li>left-arrow: Pan left, Shift = x10, Ctrl = x100</li>
	</ul>
	</li><br>

	<li><b>Parameters:</b> The bottom-left-hand window, contains the tools for changing the tool 
	selected in the Commands pane.  These are mostly sliders that you can manipulate with either
	a mouse or a touchscreen implement (stylus, or your finger).  Most tools have a reset button.<br><br>
	
	Tool panes that have integer or float parameters use a special text entry widget that responds to mousewheel
	input.  Integer widgets have a blue background; float widges have a green background.  The number in either 
	can be modified with the keyboard; click in the widget to set the focus and show an edit cursor.  Press Enter
	after changing the number to suit. Mousewheel rotation will increment/decrement the number, up to increment,
	down to decrement.  The increment for integers is 1, for floats it's the smallest number in the precision. The 
	increment can be changed by holding the Shift or Control keys while rotating the wheel; Shift multiplies the 
	increment x10, Control multiplies it by 100.  The blue/green background can be changed with the 
	app.integerctrl.backgroundcolor and app.floatctrl.backgroundcolor properties.
	</li><br>
</ol>

<p>Keyboard commands won't route to a particular pane until you click the mouse somewhere in the pane.</p>

<p>You can drag the Commands and Parameters windows from their initial positions and dock them to various sides of the 
rawproc window, or you can let them float like independent windows.  This is particularly useful for the crop and 
rotate tools; you can make the Parameters window bigger to more easily work these tools.</p>

<p>Running, rawproc looks like this:</p>

<p>There is also a status bar that will display useful feedback as you work with images, as well as the
display zoom ratio.</p>
