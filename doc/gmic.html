<h3 id="GMIC">G'MIC</h3>
<p>The toolchain organization of rawproc was inspired by G'MIC, a command-line image processor.  G'MIC has a library interface,
and I should have incorporated it a long time ago...</p>

<p>Note: While this documentation will exist in any rawproc build, the G'MIC tool will only be incorporated in the program if 
--enable-gmic is included in the autoconf ./configure command line.  Including G'MIC in the rawproc build requires the availability 
of the G'MIC library in a location that can be #included and linked in the rawproc build.</p>

<p>This tool will pass a rawproc internal image to a G'MIC script and take the result back into the rawproc toolchain.  G'MIC 
scripts are specified as files, by default located in the same directory as the one from which the opened image was obtained.
A different directory can be specified as an absolute path.  Once the script file is specified, the script is run once; by default,
if the script file is subsequently changed, the "Run Script" button needs to be clicked to re-apply it to the image.  This
behavior is overridden by the "auto update" checkbox; if this box is checked, rawproc will re-apply the script whenever the file 
is changed.</p>

<p>There are two ways to specify a script:
<ol>
<li>Script file: This way reads a G'MIC script from an external text file.  The file name is specified in the tool entry in the tool chain.</li>
<li>Embeddded script: This way saves the script in the toolchain embedded in the exported image.  The script is entered into the text box in the parameters pane.  So the script doesn't interfere with including the toolchain in a command line invocation, it is encoded in the toolchain as string of hex values.  The unencoded script can be saved to a separate file.</li>
</ol>

<p>One has to be careful writing G'MIC scripts for use with rawproc, 
as rawproc passes the image to G'MIC in its internal magnitudes, 0.0 - 1.0.  Do note that rawproc will not clip internal values 
> 1.0 if they exist.  So, if one has G'MIC scripts that depend on a 0-255 black-to-white range, they will need to be reconsidered.
